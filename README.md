## 🚀 Features

- **Ethereum Interaction:** Connects to the Ethereum blockchain to execute smart contract operations.
- **Simple Configuration:** Uses the environment variable `STAKE_VAULT_ADDRESS` to define the stake vault address.
- **Dockerized Environment:** Easy setup and execution using Docker and Docker Compose.

## 🔗 Integration with Chorus

The **Chorus** is a decentralized infrastructure that simplifies interaction with smart contracts across different blockchain networks. **Choru Ethereum** integrates with Chorus to facilitate staking operations, validation, and asset management on the Ethereum network.

The integration offers:

✅ **Fast Connection:** Optimized communication with the staking vault via the `STAKE_VAULT_ADDRESS` variable.

✅ **Security & Decentralization:** Uses the Chorus infrastructure to ensure trust in operations.

✅ **Scalability:** Chorus provides APIs that allow efficient scaling of the application.

**Next Steps:** Future enhancements may include support for additional networks and improved user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) *(if using JavaScript/TypeScript)*
- [Web3.js](https://github.com/ChainSafe/web3.js) or [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) for Ethereum blockchain interaction
- Blockchain [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dfb-chain/chorus_stake
   cd chorus_stake
   ```

2. **Configure the Environment Variable:**

   The project uses the `STAKE_VAULT_ADDRESS` variable to define the stake vault address. The default value is already set in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   environment:
     - STAKE_VAULT_ADDRESS=0xcb1d4c9834c7ee489830ff43802685d14f4c177b
   ```

   If you need to change the address, edit the file or create a `.env` file and configure it as needed.

3. **Start the Application using Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

Once the environment is running, the application will be available locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the configured port). The application will use the `STAKE_VAULT_ADDRESS` to connect and interact with the staking contract on the Ethereum network.

> **Tip:** If you want to debug or test different configurations, simply change the environment variable and restart the container.

## 🧪 Testing

To run tests (if configured), use:

```bash
npm test
```

Or, to run tests inside the container:

```bash
docker-compose run app npm test
```

Ensure the test suite is properly configured according to the project structure.

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployment can be automated using CI/CD pipelines such as GitHub Actions, combined with services like Google Cloud Run. Check your pipeline documentation for more details on the build and deployment process.
